# Local Library
The Local Library application serves as a dashboard for a neighborhood library. It provides information about the availability of books, tracks the books that are currently borrowed, and presents general statistics about the library program.

# Project Description
The project's development focused on implementing the necessary algorithms to manage the library's data and provide accurate and up-to-date information to users. While the logistics and design aspects were handled by other team members, my role was to build the underlying algorithms that power the dashboard.
